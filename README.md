# FMV-smart-contract
This smart contract keeps videos from attacks and helps checking the validity of the edited videos. 
# Database Contract
Keeps the list of all registered videos and helps people to check any video they find to know whether or not it is valid.

Use the addVideo function to add an original video to the database. If the video you try to add is similar to any previously added video, the smart contract recognizes you and does not add your video to the list.
